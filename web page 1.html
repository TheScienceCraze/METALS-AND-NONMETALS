<h1>Chemistry : Materials- Metals and Non Metals</h1>

<p> Metals and Nonmetals are different types of materials present 
around us.
 Elements can be divided into metals and nonmetals and it 
is important to know whether a particular element is a metal or 
nonmetal.
 Metals (like copper and aluminium) are good conductors of 
heat and electricity, while nonmetals (such as phosphorus and 
sulfur) are insulators.
 Materials are distinguished as above, based 
on their properties.
